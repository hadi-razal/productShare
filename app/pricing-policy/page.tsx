      <p>
        At Product Share, we offer affordable and flexible pricing options to suit your needs. Our pricing structure is designed to provide access to our online catalogue builder through two straightforward plans. Below are the details of our pricing policy:
      </p>

      <h3>Pricing Plans</h3>
      <p>
        Choose the plan that best fits your needs, with both monthly and yearly options available. Both plans are single-time purchases with no auto-pay or recurring billing.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monthly Plan:</strong> 
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'green' }}>&#8377;99</span> for a one-time payment. This plan gives you access to all features of our online catalogue builder for one month. You can renew the plan if you wish to continue using the service after the month ends.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Yearly Plan:</strong>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'green' }}>&#8377;999</span> for a one-time payment. This plan provides access to all features for an entire year, offering better value for long-term users. You can renew or switch plans at the end of the year.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Payment Details</h3>
      <p>
        All payments for our plans are processed securely. Once your payment is complete, you will have immediate access to the catalogue builder service for the selected duration. We do not store any payment details, as these plans are one-time payments without recurring billing.
      </p>

      <h3>Plan Modifications and Upgrades</h3>
      <p>
        If you wish to change your plan (e.g., switching from a monthly to a yearly plan), please reach out to our support team for assistance. Any change in plans will require a new payment for the selected plan.
      </p>

      <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
      <p>
        As our plans are based on one-time payments for a set period (monthly or yearly), we do not offer refunds after the purchase is made. Please review your selected plan carefully before proceeding with the purchase.
      </p>
