      <p>
        Product Share aims to offer a smooth experience for all customers using our digital catalogue builder. Below are the terms of our cancellation policy, applicable to both our monthly and yearly plans:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cancellation Window:</strong> Cancellation requests will be accepted only if made within 1-2 days of the purchase of either the monthly or yearly plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-refundable Purchases:</strong> Since our service provides immediate access to the catalogue builder upon payment, cancellations will not be accepted for any services already accessed, including products created using the tool.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Cancellations:</strong> Both the monthly and yearly plans are one-time purchases, and no recurring charges are applied. However, if you wish to cancel or discontinue using the service before the end of your planâ€™s duration, we will not provide a refund for any unused period.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds & Issues:</strong> In cases where you experience technical difficulties that prevent access to your digital store, or if there are significant issues preventing usage, please contact our Customer Service Team within 1-2 days of the problem. Refunds may be issued after an investigation if deemed appropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> If you encounter technical issues related to accessing or using the catalogue builder, please inform our Customer Service Team within 1-2 days, and we will work to resolve the issue promptly.</li>
        <li><strong>Refund Processing:</strong> If a refund is approved based on the conditions outlined, the refund will be processed within 1-2 business days and credited to the original payment method used for the purchase.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For any additional questions or support, please contact our Customer Service Team. We are available to assist you with any concerns.
